  //! Defines the pure virtual methods declared in Pulsar::Archive
  /*!  This class is designed to make it easier to develop new objects
    of type Pulsar::Archive.  It is a minimal implimentation of the
    Pulsar::Archive class that defines a set of variables which can be
    used to store the important information required by the
    Pulsar::Archive class.  It also defines most of the pure virtual
    methods required.  If a user wishes to work with data from a new
    instrument, they can start with the BasicArchive class and simply
    define the load and unload functions to perform file I/O. This
    should simply be a matter of reading from the file and plugging
    information into the variables defined in this class. It is
    possible for the user to add as many more features to their new
    class as required.  */

    deal with Wideband Correlator data observed during a period of heavy
    testing and development (P236).  It was observed that the system does
    not remain stable between calibrator and pulsar observations, nor from
    sub-integration to sub-integration.  Therefore, this calibrator attempts
    to correct the gains using the statistics of the off-pulse baseline.
    The error in the assumption that this baseline is unpolarized is the
    least of our concerns at this point.

    This class should be used when combining single pulse data from
    different bands, in which case each sub-band will be folded using a 
    Pulsar::Predictor that has been "tuned" to a different centre frequency.
    Consequently, the MJD of pulse #N will vary from band-to-band by the 
    dispersion smearing time.  Instead of computing the overlap from the
    Integration epochs, this class computes the overlap of the pulse phase 
    regions predicted by the Pulsar::Predictor phase model at the Integration
    epochs.
